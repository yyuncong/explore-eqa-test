{"_comment": "Use this file to stop 'realtime_mapping.py' and 'streamlined_mapping.py' from doing their usual work in the middle of running. Here's how it works: As these scripts run, they check this file at every iteration of their main loop. If they see 'exit_early' is changed to true, they skip right to the final frame, so the final cleanup and processing still happens and the map built so far is saved. This is handy if you suddenly decide you don't need the scripts to process the rest of the scan and you'd rather just wrap things up quickly. All you have to do is open this file while the script is running, change 'exit_early' to true, and save the file. The scripts will notice this change at the next iteration of the loop", "exit_early": false}
